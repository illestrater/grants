I fell in love with film photography because of the natural way in which the film would react to and blend light which made each photo so much more meaning full and emotive. Having only a few frames to shoot, makes you compose and look at a scene in more detail. \n\nThis piece I submitted was my attempt in merging my love for that rich HP5 film aesthetic with computer-generated scenes. I Like to add the slightest bit of motion blur to my works as I feel it adds or instigates a more emotive response.
