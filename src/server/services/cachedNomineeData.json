Your clothes, sports, the colors you associate with, your relationship with your body, with others, so many things that are expected from you. These elements can sometimes appear insignificant but they do create your identity. Little humans looking for their true selves end up parasitized by the old traditional norms. How is it possible to be ashamed of something that you did not choose and that has absolutely no consequences on others? I perceive this as so much pressure for someone who does not have the keys to understand the world yet. This artwork aims to show how difficult a childhood can be when everyone is telling you what to do. Some of\nthem will fight; some will wait years before accepting themselves and others probably never will.
